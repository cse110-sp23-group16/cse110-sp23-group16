# What we've done so far...
Our goal for the phase 1 pipeline is to create a system to easily build and quickly test code. This will a tremendous help to our developers because it allows us to push a new file and immediately receive feedback in terms of the code quality as well as proper documentation. Here are the steps we took this week in order to begin building a strong foundation.

## JsDocs--Documentation
JsDocs allows developers annotate JavaScript files in a easier and cleanner manner. Features such as auto documentation, comment template generator, and html converter makes this tool very valuable for our group, which is why we decided to use it for our project. 
JsDocs is fully functional for the team to use. All members need to do is to download Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download) and in their terminal of VS Code write 'npm install -g jsdoc'. Afterwards, JsDocs is fully functional. 
We tested JsDocs by creating a separate branch with a source and a test files. The source incldues a function to add two numbers. The test file checks if the function works appropriately. Finally, we ensured that a fully documented HTML file is created by typing the command 'jsdoc <nameOfFile.js>. JsDocs now also works for the rest of the project.

# App Pitch - Stargazer

## Statement of Purpose / Problem

<p>
  The problem our application, Stargazer, wants to address is the universal human concern for the future, whether it is due to superstition or fear or optimism or plain curiosity for the future. Oftentimes, people seek guidance or clarity on their personal and professional life but lack the willingness to share their feelings and concerns to people in-person, thus seeking personal spiritualistic avenues online. Our application intends to be a outlet for users to have their burning questions about the the future answered by incorporating astrological signs and star predictions. 
</p>

## Solution
<p>
  The user, upon entering our web application, is prompted by the teller to ask a question about their future. The teller then takes them on a guided experience, where they search the night sky full of stars, and select stars that call out to them. Upon selecting the stars they resonate most with, a constellation matching those stars slowly emerge, as the teller details the mythology and meaning behind their chosen sign. The teller wraps up by giving advice on their original question based off of the chosen sign.

## Risks and Rabbit Holes
- We should focus on our core features and the user experience first, and then expand to other functions/features. An abundance of features, despite how cool or useful, will be overwhelming to the user and overcomplicate their experience
- We may need to use new and unfamiliar tools for both the front and backend development, such as CSS animations, and potenatially new APIs (although we will try to mitigate this by using built-in APIs as much as possible)
- Having a goal that’s either too specific, to the point that it leaves no room for adaptability, or under-specified, to the point that we are unsure of what we are working towards
- Ensuring everyone is on the same page in terms of what the end user experience should be like, and where we are in terms of development
- Not maintaining quality documentation, as that will make development/adaption more difficult, especially when it comes to unfamiliar tools

## Similar Apps and Competition
- We have competition in the form of other tarot card, fortune predictors, and palm readers online, as well as star viewers/online planetariums
- More classical online fortune predictors have the advantage of following established ceremonies/rituals and therefore have the advantage of familiarity
- Star viewers and online planetariums are very accurate to the real world, and designed for astronomy enthusiasts
- Our app is unique in being at the intersection of fortune telling and astronomy, and we are poised to offer a unique experience in the world of astrology and star predictions

## No-Gos
- The Ability share/post your results with friends
- Focusing too much on the UI/UX of the web application
- Making the web application secure
- Too many steps/instructions to the ceremony/ritual process
- The ability to upload images 
- The ability to save the user's previous results
- Don’t focus on real animation–mainly use css
- Creating real animations (we will stick to CSS)
- User authentication

# Roadmap for 6/7:
As of right now, we've completed v3 of our fortune teller app. We established the funamental features of our app including a landing page, sky map page, 
explanation page, response page, and thank you page. All of which helps create a cohesive and emersive user experience. For the landing page, the categories
work to be selected and the next page works as well. The sky map page include various versions of stars that the user can be clicked to create a constellation.
The explaantion page generates the history and meaning behind the constellation picked. The response page tells the user what that constellation entails for them.
Finally the thank you page finishes off the fortune teller app. 

We are currently trying to add more features to make our app more fluid. Currently, all the information jumps out at you. Instead we are aiming to transition the 
text more smoother to have a simpler and engaging user experience. Adding music is another way of doing this. There are other behind the scenes items such as 
unit testing, JSDocs for every file, ADR documentation updates, pupeteer tests, making releases automatic, change logs, slack integration, and finally include 
a voice narrating the text.

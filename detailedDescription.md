# Landing page

Within the landing page, the user will be prompted with an almighty armadillo floating in the top half of the screen with a text box below. This input allows users to ask a question of their choice in order to gain insight to their life. Once the user types in their question, they are guided towards the sky, as mystical music begins to play.

# Constellation Skymap Page

In this page, the app pans up to the background, which is a dark canvas sprinkled with stars. The user is prompted to select stars that call to them. Once the user begins selecting stars they are locked into that region of the sky, and as they select more a constellation begins to fade in.

# Explanation Page

Here the app displays the constellation that matches the stars the user picked. The armadillo begins to explain the meaning of the constellation, and its mythical significance.

# Fortune Teller Response Page

The armadillo teller begins explaining how the constellation you chose affects your life and will guide you regarding the question the user asked at the beginning of the Stargazer experience

# Thank You Page

Once arriving at this page, the app will conclude the fortune telling and wishes the user to be wise with the information they just attained. The user has the option to ask another question, or leave the site.

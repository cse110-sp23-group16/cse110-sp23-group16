Note: whats the fortunte teller page?
User open the app for the first time, we see the silloute of an individual watching the sunset. As the sun slowly sinks below the horizon, the app pans the camera into the sky that
has nothing except eternal darkness. Immediately, the user will be directed to the landing page. Peaceful/tranquil music will be playing.

# Landing page
Within the landing page, the user will be prompted with an almighty armadillo floaing in the top half of the screen with a text box bellow. This input allows users to ask a question 
of their choice in order to gain insight to their life. Once the user types in their question, we then move to the constellation page. Mystical music will be playing.

# Constellation Page
In this page, the app zooms into the background, which is a dark canvas sprinkled with starts (they just pop up one at a time). Users then begin to choose stars that speaks to them.
Once the user chooses seven stars, the app will zoom into the specific stars they chose, which will then be the explanation page.

# Explanation Page
Here, the app will highlight the stars the user chose, then reveal a constellation that closely matches the stars the user picked. From here, a side pannel with the armadilo and 
explanation will come in and explain the specific meaning of the constellation and how it answers the user's question. 

# Thank You Page
Once arriving at this page, the app will conclude the fortune telling and wishes the user to be wise with the information they just attained and hope good fortunes come now that they
know what to expect in at least one aspect of their future.

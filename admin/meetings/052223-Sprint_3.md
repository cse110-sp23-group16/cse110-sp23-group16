## To Do

Dev Team: 
- EVERYONE ensure code follows the rules for the cicd pipeline. update style and everything. 
- create some simple tests while creating your pages. (3 tests per person) due Friday. 
- Finish the skymap due: Friday (Jerry)
- Fixed number of responses 48 for each category due: Thursday 
- Determine categories for our constellations (aim for 10 categories) : Tuesday 
- Would want to have 10 constellation.
- Mobile Version: give the team an update on Thursday. Goal is to have v1 finished by Sat. 
- Polish your page (everyone) due: Wednesday. 

CI/CD: 
- Need linter, not just prettier. Ik there's a feature that is a part of prettier that we can just add. eds linter? something like that 
- include why we chose canvas and cocdeclimate over codecy. 
- Jest might not be useful. have a proper property that renders the browser and actually chooses the constellations. want to test ui directly. Unit integration needs a new app.
- video not showing cicdpipeline correctly. maybe upload to YouTube and insert a link?
- 3 new assignments have been dropped. Start working on em. 
- work on mvp
